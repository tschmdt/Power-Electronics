The TCSC can operate in capacitive or inductive mode, although the latter is rarely used in practice.
Since the resonance for this TCSC is around 58deg firing angle, the operation is prohibited in firing angle range 49deg - 69deg. The capacitive mode is achieved with firing angles 69-90deg.

This model only displays the capacitive behavior.
