The TCSC can operate in capacitive or inductive mode, although the latter is rarely used in practice.
Since the resonance for this TCSC is around 58deg firing angle, the operation is prohibited in firing angle range 49deg - 69deg. The capacitive mode is achieved with firing angles 69-90deg.

This model only displays the capacitive behavior.

A voltage profile can be fed to the programmable voltage source, i.e. V is reduced to 0.96 p.u. after 3.3s.
Same applies for the reference impedance. Profile could change after 2.5 (and 5s) to 0.95*128 Ohm.
Both can be applied to see the dynamic behaviour of the TCSC.

Here, this "profile" has been omitted for simplification.
