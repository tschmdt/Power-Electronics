Feature			Cassie Arc Model			Mayr Arc Model



Key Variable		Arc Resistance (R)			Arc conductance (g)
	
Focus			Electrical behaviour (V and I)		Thermal behaviour (Energy balance)

Arc power		Constant power Dissipation		Power depends on arc conductance and cooling

Thermal effects		Less emphasis on thermal eff.		Emphasizes heat Dissipation and cooling

Typical use case	high current arcs (faults, switching)	low current or long duration arcs (circuit Breakers, switiching)

Arc extinction		Resistance increases as I decreases	Conductance decreases as Energy disspiates
